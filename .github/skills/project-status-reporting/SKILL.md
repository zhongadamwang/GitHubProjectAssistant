# Project Status Reporting

Generates standardized status reports, executive dashboards, and stakeholder communications by aggregating data from project documentation structures and tracking artifacts.

## Intent

Aggregate status data from EDPS project documentation artifacts (task tracking, project plans, milestone data) and generate audience-appropriate reports — executive dashboards, engineering detail, or stakeholder briefings — with minimal manual data entry.

## Inputs

- **Project root**: Path to `OrgDocument/projects/[NN] - [Project Name]/`
- **Optional**: `tasks/task-tracking.md` — task completion data
- **Optional**: `project-plan.md` — milestone schedule baseline
- **Report type**: `executive` | `engineering` | `stakeholder` | `full` (default: `full`)

## Outputs

- Formatted status report Markdown file appropriate for the requested audience
- Console summary: overall completion percentage, count of blocked items, and upcoming milestones

## Core Function

**Input**: Project data from document tree, tracking files, milestone status
**Output**: Formatted reports, dashboards, presentations for various stakeholder audiences

## GitHub-Integrated Status Reporting

### Modern Data Sources

For projects using GitHub-integrated task management structure:

#### Primary Data Sources
- `tasks/task-tracking.md` → Current progress metrics
- `tasks/T##-task-name.md` → Individual task status
- `project-plan.md` → PERT analysis and critical path  
- `tasks/README.md` → Task management workflow status
- GitHub Issues API → Real-time collaboration data

#### Enhanced Status Report Template

```markdown
# Project Status Report - [Project Name]
**Period**: [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Report Date**: [Date]
**Project Manager**: [Name]

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Status**: [🟢 On Track | 🟡 At Risk | 🔴 Behind]
- **Phase**: [Current phase from project plan]
- **Critical Path Status**: [From PERT analysis]
- **GitHub Integration**: [Active/Synced/Issues tracking]

## Progress Metrics
### Task Completion (from task-tracking.md)
- **Phase 1**: [X]/[Total] tasks complete ([X]%)
- **Overall Project**: [X]/[Total] tasks complete ([X]%)
- **Critical Path**: [On schedule/X days behind/ahead]

### Team Collaboration (from GitHub Issues)
- **Active Issues**: [Count] 
- **Comments This Period**: [Count]
- **External Feedback**: [Quality/volume assessment]

## Phase Status
### Phase 1: [Phase Name] 
**Status**: [In Progress/Complete]
**Key Accomplishments**:

## Risks & Issues
| ID | Issue | Impact | GitHub Issue | Owner | Target Resolution |
|----|-------|---------|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| R1 | [Description] | [High/Med/Low] | [#Issue] | [Name] | [Date] |

## Next Period Focus
### Critical Path Tasks
- T##: [Task name] - [Critical dependency]

### GitHub Activities  
- [Expected issue comments/reviews]
- [Planned task imports/exports]

### Stakeholder Actions Required
- [Decision needed]
- [Approval required]
```

#### Automated Reporting Capabilities

When using GitHub integration:

1. **Task Progress**: Automatically calculated from T##-task-name.md file states
2. **Team Activity**: GitHub API provides collaboration metrics
3. **Dependency Tracking**: PERT analysis combined with GitHub issue linking
4. **Historical Trends**: GitHub commit history shows documentation evolution
5. **External Feedback**: Issue comments provide stakeholder input metrics

This approach enables both traditional project reporting and modern distributed team collaboration tracking.
